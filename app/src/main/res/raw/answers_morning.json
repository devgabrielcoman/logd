  "I had lovely dreams last night.",
  "Can't remember what I dreamt but woke up pretty OK.",
  "Woke up after a nightmare. How awful!",
  "Today I'm ready to take on the world!",
  "It's a decent morning today.",
  "Ugh! It's one of those mornings.",
  "Oh, I wish I could sleep more.",
  "Need ... coffee ...",
  "Was an early bird today. I feel energised.",
  "Woke up with a hangover. Never. Again!",
  "Made breakfast this morning and felt good about myself."
